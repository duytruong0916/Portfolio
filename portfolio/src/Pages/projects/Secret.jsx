      I built this web application during my summer break.It was my first
      front-end project. Whole web platform (back-end and front-end) was
      completely my work. Overall, about one month of my full-time work resulted
      in a responsive web application, with features like:
    </>,
    <>Sign up/log in/log out.</>,
    <>Add/edit/remove a memory post.</>,
    <>Add multiple images to a memory post</>,
