 I dont have the CMS ( which I really want) for this project, so you need to follow these following 
 steps to update the project content:

## step 1:
Create a new folder in src/assets/[new folder name] to store the images of the project
## step 2:
Add the project information in src/Constants
There are 2 two types of projects
+ Featured.
+ Normal
For feature projects, you will need to have a background image for it that will be shown in the home page.
## step 3: Time to really create a project 
Create a file for the project in src/components/projects
Fill out the fields and import images in the file you just created (Copy the template from the other projects)
## step 4: Now get it live
Update the route in src/Routes.jsx

Congratulation !!!! You successfully added a new project.
